.. function:: model_train_test(mode, x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test)

    :param mode: set it as "regression", if you want to do regression OR set it as "classification", if you want to do classification
    :type mode: str

    :param x_train: the x_train
    :type x_train: output from sklearn train_test_split()

    :param y_train: the y_train
    :type y_train: output from sklearn train_test_split() 

    :param x_test: the x_test
    :type x_test: output from sklearn train_test_split()

    :param y_test: the y_test
    :type y_test: output from sklearn train_test_split()
